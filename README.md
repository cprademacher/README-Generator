# Professional README Generator

## Description

I built this project to allow users to quickly and easily create a README file from their command line.  I learned
how to better work with npm packages and write new files with nodejs.

## Installation

I simply wrote the code on my local VS Code and pushed it to GitHub.

## Usage

Users will open the terminal and move to the index.js file.  From there they will enter 'node index.js' into the terminal and answer the prompted questions.
